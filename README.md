# moving_postcode_filter

This project is (for now) a little shiny app that will be used during our research of a house to see interesting data on the possible postcodes.

## Summary of the app

### Inputs

The main input is the postcode that we want to check. The format doesn't matter.


### Outputs

We return the following plots / results:

- elevation

- flood risk

- IMD scores

- number of cats

- number of dogs
